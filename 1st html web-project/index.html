      Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to
      tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and
      Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2]
      Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, in the equatorial
      regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa.
      The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe,
      coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds
      (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the
      desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling
      water to produce the beverage known as coffee.https://codesandbox.io/embed/romantic-neumann-mdybi?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark

      Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating
      effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of
      the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can be prepared and
      presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè
      latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular
      alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is
      benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on
      whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although
      those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.

      As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing
      one-third of the world total.[8] Coffee is a major export commodity, being
      the top legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[4][9][failed
      verification] It is one of the most valuable commodities by developing
      countries. Green, unroasted coffee is one of the most traded agricultural
      commodities in the world.[10] The way developed countries trade coffee
      with developing nations has been criticised, as well as the impact on the
      environment with regards to the clearing of land for coffee-growing and
      water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade and organic coffee are
      expanding.
